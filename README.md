 These problems relate to the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set. Save your work as a Python file, or a collection of Python files.
# Exercise 1.Read the data files
 Download the image and label files from [Here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) then decompress and read them byte by byte into appropriate data structures 
# Exercise 2.Output an image to the console
 Output the third image in the training set to the console. Do this by representing any pixel value less than 128 as a full stop and any other pixel value as a hash symbol.
# Exercise 3.Output the image files as PNGs
